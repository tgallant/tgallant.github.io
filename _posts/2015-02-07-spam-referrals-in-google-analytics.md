I've been getting spam referral links in Google Analytics for a few
months now. It is a bit annoying but I didn't think anything of it.
Recently though, I noticed that these spammers are evolving. 

Here is a screenshot from a few months ago.

This one really caught my attention. I actually clicked through to see
what it was. Who knows, some website like that might exist and have
came across my site. I felt betrayed when I was redirected to the
click bait-y  ilovevitaly.ru.

These sites exist to make money for their owners. They make bogus
page views on your site and hope that you'll click through to their
site when you see it in your analytics. To me this new wave of domains
making spam referral links has gone a bit too far. I'd hate for this
to continue to grow.
